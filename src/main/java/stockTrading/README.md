# Stock Trading Problem

Design and implement an efficient in-memory trading system similar to a stock exchange, where registered users can
place, execute and cancel trades. The system should demonstrate synchronization and concurrency in a multi-threaded
environment.
Your system should be able to perform the following items:

Functional Requirements:
Your system should support the following functionalities:

* A registered user can place, modify, and cancel his orders.
* A user should be able to query the status of his order
* [IMPORTANT] - The system should be able to execute trades based on matching buy and sell orders. A trade is executed
  when the buy and sell price of two different orders match/are equal. If multiple eligible orders can be matched with
  the same price, match the oldest orders first.
* [IMPORTANT] - Concurrent order placement, modification, cancellation, and execution should be handled appropriately.
* The system should maintain an order book per symbol, which holds all the current unexecuted orders.
  Your system should store at least the following mentioned details.
* User details
    * User ID
    * User Name
    * Phone Number
    * Email Id
* Orders
    * Order ID
    * User ID
    * OrderType (Buy/Sell)
    * Stock Symbol (eg: RELIANCE, WIPRO etc.)
    * Quantity
    * Price
    * Order Accepted Timestamp
    * Status (ACCEPTED, REJECTED, CANCELED)
* Trades
    * Trade ID
    * Trade Type (Buy/Sell)
    * Buyer Order Id
    * Seller Order Id
    * Stock Symbol
    * Quantity
    * Price
    * Trade Timestamp

Additional functionality, but not compulsory [implement if time permits]:

* Implement order expiry. A order should be automatically canceled if that order is not executed within a specific time.

* Expectation:
* Your code should be executable (at worst partial running would work) & should be clean.
* Your code should be adequately refactored, and exceptions should be gracefully handled.
* Your code should store all the attributes explained under the "Stores" section.
* Your code should cover all the functionality in the "Supports" section.
* If you get extra time, you can code for " Additional functionality, but not compulsory." This will get you extra
  credit.
  Guidelines:
* You don't have to build the user registration part. Consider some dummy users registered and use those in the entire
  system.
* You should use the in-memory data structure of your preferred language to store the data but have the right
  abstractions so that other persistent stores can be plugged in.
  Evaluation criteria:
* Executable code.
* Code readability and testability
* Refactored code
* Abstraction
* Object-Oriented concepts.
* Language proficiency.
* [execution time limit] 3 seconds (java)
* [memory limit] 1 GB
